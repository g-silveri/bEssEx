## Thanks

- The initial draft was inspired in [Andrea Ponzano](https://github.com/andreaponzano)'s concept of extended [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) features.<br />
It went on to become [this full-fledged front-end framework](https://github.com/g-silveri/bessex) and a rudimentary scheme that, due to the efforts of [Humanbit](https://humanbit.com/)'s team, eventually developed into a [full-stack modular template structure](https://github.com/g-silveri/humanbit-templates-symphonycms).<br />
These systems were designed to be used in combination with one another but they're perfectly fit for independent usage as well.
- This repository is entirely based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)'s SCSS architecture as it relies on its [source files](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/download/#source-files).
- A special mention must be made of [Humanbit](https://humanbit.com) as a whole for having entrusted me with the opportunity (and responsability) to develop my professional knowledge through the creation of this tool.
